Testing the sequence for anomaly detection: 72, 67, 66, 90, 69, 97.

Current element in the testing sequence: 72
No anomaly detected in the next element. HTM Engine found similarity: 95.83%.
Current element in the testing sequence: 67
No anomaly detected in the next element. HTM Engine found similarity: 83.33%.
Current element in the testing sequence: 66
****Anomaly detected**** in the next element. HTM Engine predicted: 70 with similarity: 100%, actual value: 90.
Skipping to the next element in the testing sequence due to detected anomaly.
Current element in the testing sequence: 69
****Anomaly detected**** in the next element. HTM Engine predicted: 72 with similarity: 100%, actual value: 97.
Skipping to the next element in the testing sequence due to detected anomaly.

Average accuracy for this sequence: 63.19333333333333%.
